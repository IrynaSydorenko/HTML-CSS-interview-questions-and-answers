<summary>### What is the purpose of semantic HTML? When and where is it important?</summary>

Semantic HTML provides meaning to the web page structure by using tags that reflect the purpose of the content inside them (e.g., `<article>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, etc.).

**Why itâ€™s important:**

- **Accessibility**: Helps screen readers and assistive technologies understand content structure.
- **SEO**: Search engines use semantic tags to better index and rank content.
- **Maintainability**: Easier for developers to read and update code.
- **Consistency**: Promotes a standardized way of building layouts.

**When and where to use:**  
Always prefer semantic tags when the content has a clear role or meaning. For example:

- Use `<nav>` for site navigation.
- Use `<article>` for blog posts or news entries.
- Use `<footer>` for contact info and legal disclaimers.

<summary>### What can a form consist of? What are the main attributes of a form and its elements, and what do they do? How to validate a form?</summary>

A form typically consists of the following elements:

- `<form>`: The container that wraps all form elements and defines the form action (where the data should be sent) and method (how the data should be sent, usually GET or POST).
- `<input>`: The most common form element, used for receiving user input (text, number, date, etc.).
- `<label>`: Provides a label for a form element, improving accessibility and usability by associating the label text with a specific input field.
- `<textarea>`: Used for multi-line text input (e.g., comments or messages).
- `<select>`: A dropdown menu for selecting one or more options from a list.
- `<button>`: Used to submit the form or trigger actions.
- `<fieldset>`: Groups related form elements together, often with a `<legend>` element for a title.

### Main attributes of form elements:

- **`name`**: Specifies the name of the form element, which is sent with the form data.
- **`value`**: Specifies the initial value of an input element.
- **`placeholder`**: Provides a short hint inside an input field about what value is expected.
- **`required`**: Indicates that a field must be filled out before submitting the form.
- **`disabled`**: Prevents interaction with a form element.
- **`readonly`**: Makes a form element non-editable, but still selectable.
- **`min`, `max`**: Sets limits for numeric or date inputs.
- **`pattern`**: Specifies a regular expression for validating input values.

### Form validation:

- **Client-side validation**: Done using HTML attributes (like `required`, `minlength`, `pattern`) or JavaScript to check input before submission.
- **Server-side validation**: Done on the server after form submission to ensure data integrity and security.
- **HTML5 validation**: Modern HTML provides built-in validation (e.g., for email, URL, or number inputs), but can be enhanced with JavaScript for custom checks.

    ###What is the difference between PNG and JPG? What are the advantages of SVG?
  </summary>
  ## PNG vs JPG:

### PNG (Portable Network Graphics):

- Lossless compression (no data is lost during compression).
- Supports transparency (alpha channel).
- Larger file sizes due to lossless compression.
- Best for images with text, logos, or images needing transparency.

### JPG (JPEG - Joint Photographic Experts Group):

- Lossy compression (some image data is lost during compression).
- Smaller file sizes compared to PNG.
- Does not support transparency.
- Ideal for photographs or images with gradients and lots of colors.

## Advantages of SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):

- **Scalability**: SVG images are resolution-independent and can be scaled to any size without loss of quality, making them perfect for responsive designs.
- **Smaller file size**: For images that can be represented by vectors, SVG files tend to be smaller than raster images like PNG or JPG.
- **Editable**: SVG files can be edited with code, allowing for easy modification of elements (such as colors, shapes, and sizes) without needing a graphic editor.
- **Interactive**: SVG can be manipulated using CSS and JavaScript, allowing for animations and interactivity in web pages.
- **Accessibility**: Since SVGs are text-based, they can be indexed by search engines and are often more accessible than other formats.
