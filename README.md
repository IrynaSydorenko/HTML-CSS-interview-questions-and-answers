<summary>What is the purpose of semantic HTML? When and where is it important? </summary>

Semantic HTML provides meaning to the web page structure by using tags that reflect the purpose of the content inside them 
(`<article>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, etc.).

**Why it’s important:**

- **Accessibility**: Helps screen readers and assistive technologies understand content structure.
- **SEO**: Search engines use semantic tags to better index and rank content.
- **Maintainability**: Easier for developers to read and update code.
- **Consistency**: Promotes a standardized way of building layouts.

**When and where to use:**  
Always prefer semantic tags when the content has a clear role or meaning. For example:

- Use `<nav>` for site navigation.
- Use `<article>` for blog posts or news entries.
- Use `<footer>` for contact info and legal disclaimers.

<summary>What can a form consist of? What are the main attributes of a form and its elements, and what do they do? How to validate a form?</summary>

A form typically consists of the following elements:

- `<form>`: The container that wraps all form elements and defines the form action (where the data should be sent) and method (how the data should be sent, usually GET or POST).
- `<input>`: The most common form element, used for receiving user input (text, number, date, etc.).
- `<label>`: Provides a label for a form element, improving accessibility and usability by associating the label text with a specific input field.
- `<textarea>`: Used for multi-line text input (e.g., comments or messages).
- `<select>`: A dropdown menu for selecting one or more options from a list.
- `<button>`: Used to submit the form or trigger actions.
- `<fieldset>`: Groups related form elements together, often with a `<legend>` element for a title.

## Why bind a `<label>` to an `<input>`?

Using `<label>` elements correctly is important for both accessibility and user experience. Here's why:

1. **Accessibility for screen readers**  
   When a label is properly associated with an input (via the `for` attribute or by wrapping the input), screen readers announce the label text when the input is focused.  
   ➤ Without this, users with visual impairments won’t know what the input is for.

2. **Clickable area**  
   Binding a label to an input makes the label clickable, which means clicking the label will focus or toggle the input (e.g., toggles a checkbox or focuses a text field).  
   ➤ This improves UX, especially for small elements like checkboxes and radio buttons.

3. **Better semantic structure**  
   Associating labels with inputs improves the semantic correctness of your form.  
   ➤ It helps browsers and assistive technologies interpret and handle the form more effectively.

---

### Use cases:

- ✅ Use `<label>` for single input descriptions.
- ✅ Use `<fieldset>` + `<legend>` to group and describe sets of related inputs.


### Main attributes of form elements:

### For `<form>`:
- `action` – URL where the form data is sent after submission.
- `method` – HTTP method used (`GET` or `POST`).
- `target` – where to open the response (e.g., `_self`, `_blank`).
- `novalidate` – disables browser's built-in validation.

### For form elements:
- `name` – key used to identify the input’s data when the form is submitted.
- `value` – the current value of the input.
- `type` – defines the kind of input (`text`, `email`, `password`, `checkbox`, etc.).
- `required` – input must be filled out before submitting.
- `min`, `max`, `minlength`, `maxlength` – limit input range or length.
- `pattern` – regex to define custom input format.
- `placeholder` – text shown inside the input before user types.
- `readonly`, `disabled` – restrict editing or interaction.

### Form validation:

- **Client-side validation**: Done using HTML attributes (like `required`, `minlength`, `pattern`) or JavaScript to check input before submission.
- **Server-side validation**: Done on the server after form submission to ensure data integrity and security.
- **HTML5 validation**: Modern HTML provides built-in validation (e.g., for email, URL, or number inputs), but can be enhanced with JavaScript for custom checks.

    What is the difference between PNG and JPG? What are the advantages of SVG?
  </summary>
   PNG vs JPG:

### PNG (Portable Network Graphics):

- Lossless compression (no data is lost during compression).
- Supports transparency (alpha channel).
- Larger file sizes due to lossless compression.
- Best for images with text, logos, or images needing transparency.

### JPG (JPEG - Joint Photographic Experts Group):

- Lossy compression (some image data is lost during compression).
- Smaller file sizes compared to PNG.
- Does not support transparency.
- Ideal for photographs or images with gradients and lots of colors.

## Advantages of SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):

- **Scalability**: SVG images are resolution-independent and can be scaled to any size without loss of quality, making them perfect for responsive designs.
- **Smaller file size**: For images that can be represented by vectors, SVG files tend to be smaller than raster images like PNG or JPG.
- **Editable**: SVG files can be edited with code, allowing for easy modification of elements (such as colors, shapes, and sizes) without needing a graphic editor.
- **Interactive**: SVG can be manipulated using CSS and JavaScript, allowing for animations and interactivity in web pages.
- **Accessibility**: Since SVGs are text-based, they can be indexed by search engines and are often more accessible than other formats.

<summary>How are flex items positioned inside a flex container? How to change the axis direction?</summary>

When an element has `display: flex`, its direct children become **flex items**. By default:

- The **main axis** is horizontal (left to right).
- Items are placed in a row from left to right (`flex-direction: row` by default).
- They follow the flow of the main axis and wrap only if `flex-wrap` is enabled.

Positioning is controlled by:
- `justify-content`: aligns items along the **main axis** (horizontal by default).
- `align-items`: aligns items along the **cross axis** (vertical by default).


Use the `flex-direction` property:
- `row` (default): left to right
- `row-reverse`: right to left
- `column`: top to bottom
- `column-reverse`: bottom to top

Example:
```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

<summary>❓ What issues can occur when using inline-blocks for layout, and how can we fix them? Where does the extra space between them come from?</summary>

✅ **Answer:**

### Issues with `inline-block` layout

When you use `display: inline-block` to place elements side by side, a **horizontal space (gap)** often appears between them — similar to the space between words in a sentence.

---

### 🔍 Why does the gap appear?

The gap is caused by **whitespace characters** (spaces, tabs, newlines) in the HTML between the elements. Inline-block elements are treated like inline text, so this whitespace is rendered as a visible gap.

Example:
```html
<div class="box"></div> <div class="box"></div>

✅ **Solutions to remove the gap:**

1. Remove whitespace in HTML

```html
<div class="box"></div><div class="box"></div>
```

2. Use HTML comments to hide the whitespace

```html
<div class="box"></div><!--
--><div class="box"></div>
```

3. Set `font-size: 0` on the container

```css
.container {
  font-size: 0;
}
```

4. Use Flexbox or CSS Grid instead These layout models are modern, more powerful, and do not suffer from this whitespace issue.
